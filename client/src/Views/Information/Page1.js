                <b>What is share? What is share market?</b>
                <br />
                When we divide the capital of any company in small small equal
                parts. That single small part is called as Share. <br />
                For eg. - If there is a company named as <i>InvestingIQ-Hub</i>
                having capital of 1,000/- Rs. If we divide this in 100 equal
                parts with same ammount then single part cost 10Rs. This small
                part called as Share. <br />
                ðŸ‘‰ If you have to know the total share capital of company -{" "}
                <br />
                <span className="formula">
                  Total share capital = Total share of company x Share price
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />I think you might have understand that when you buy an
                share it means you are taking an ownership as per ammount of
                share you buy. <br />
                Moving to next question. Basically when you here market word you
                remember that there is selling and buying of vegetables and
                fruits. In the same way it is also market place where buying and
                selling of stocks occurs.
