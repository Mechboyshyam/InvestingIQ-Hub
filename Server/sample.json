If we divide this capital into 100 equal parts with some amount, each part will cost 10 Rs. This single component is known as Share. If you want to know the company's total share capital, multiply it by the share price. I believe you now realize that purchasing shares entails assuming a certain level of ownership in proportion to the number of shares you purchase."

However, there are a few minor variations in the stock market where stock purchases and sales take place. A market is an area were buying and selling takes place; since stock is traded here, the term "stock market" is used. Thus, to put it simply, a share market is a marketplace where stocks are bought and sold. Buyers and sellers are the two groups of people who matter most in the market."
